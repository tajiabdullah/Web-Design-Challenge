# Web Design Homework

## Latitude Analysis Dashboard

For this homework I created a visualization dashboard website using visualizations that I were used in a past assignment. 
In building this dashboard, I created individual pages for each plot and a means to navigate between them. These pages will contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations. I also have (1) a landing page, (2) a page where we can see a comparison of all the plots, and (3) another page to view the data used to build them.

## Website Attributes

The website consists of 7 pages total, including: webpages as follows. 
A landing page containing:
* An explanation of the project
* Links to each visualizations page with a sidebar containing preview images of each plot and a hyperlink that takes the user to that visualization.

Four visualization pages with each one containing:
* A descriptive title and heading tag.
* The plot/visualization itself for the selected comparison
* A paragraph describing the plot and its significance

A comparisons page that:
* Contains all the visualizations on the same page for easy comparison
* Uses a Bootstrap grid for the visualizations

A data page that:
* Displays a responsive table containing the data used in the visualizations
* **Note:** The table must be a bootstrap table component. 

## Additional Attributes

The website possesses a navigation menu at the top of every page, which:
* Has the name of the site on the left of the nav that allows users to return to the landing page from any page
* Contains a dropdown menu on the right of the navbar named "Plots" that provides a link to each individual visualization page
* Provides two more text links on the right: "Comparisons," which links to the comparisons page, and "Data," which links to the data page.
